# About

A passion was kindled in 1998 with the creation of my first website through GeoCities. When Yahoo acquired GeoCities the next year, I received the perk of a free domain by being "grandfathered" into the promotional campaign as a legacy member.

During the final years of the previous millennium, a large portion of my work was dedicated to ensuring Y2K compliancy of large, legacy systems. Following the burst of the dot com bubble at the dawn of the new century, a passion for building websites took hold which has grown progressively stronger ever since.

Many years have now passed, the days of the personal domain freebies are long gone, and technology has advanced by telescopic proportions, yet the passion has grown in parallel.

I now focus primarily on constructing websites. Why? Because I enjoy it! And by enjoying your work, it is no longer considered a job, but a pass time.
