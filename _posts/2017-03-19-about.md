# About

In 1996, I started to independently provide services in the areas of:

1. Management & Technology Consulting
2. E-Commerce applications
3. **[Website Development][0]**

During the final years of the previous millennium, a large portion of my work was dedicated to ensuring Y2K compliancy of large, legacy systems. Following the burst of the dot com bubble at the dawn of the new century, a passion for building websites took hold which has grown progressively stronger ever since.

I now focus primarily on constructing websites. Why? Because I enjoy it! And by enjoying your work, it is no longer considered a job, but a pass time.
